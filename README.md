A user-friendly Python script to download the original Chinese-language chapters of any webnovel from `lnmtl.com`. This tool is perfect for language learners, aspiring translators, or readers who want to build an offline library of their favorite novels.

The script prompts you for the novel's name and a specific chapter range, then intelligently handles the restâ€”from formatting the URL correctly to organizing the downloaded chapters into neat, dedicated folders.

---

## Features

-   **Crawl Any Novel**: Works with any novel available on `lnmtl.com`.
-   **Custom Chapter Ranges**: Specify exactly which chapters you want to download (e.g., chapters 50 to 150).
-   **Smart Name Handling**: Automatically creates URL-friendly "slugs" from complex names like `"Emperor's Domination"` or `"Douluo Dalu 3 - Dragon King's Legend"`.
-   **Organized Output**: Creates a main `Books` directory, with a dedicated sub-folder for each novel you download.
-   **Respectful Crawling**: Includes a configurable politeness delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles common network errors and missing pages.
-   **User-Friendly**: Simple, interactive command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have **Python 3.7 or newer** installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
